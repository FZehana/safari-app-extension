# Zotero Safari App Extension Connector

## Building for Development

1. Clone this repository
1. Clone https://github.com/zotero/zotero-connectors next to it
1. Make sure the `zotero-connectors` repo directory is named `zotero-connectors` and placed in the same folder as this repository
1. Build the `zotero-connectors` repository
1. Open the project in XCode, build and run the project
1. Anytime the code in `zotero-connectors` is changed the project needs to be cleaned (Cmd-Shift-K) before building, otherwise Safari complains about the signature being invalid

## Developing/Structure
